## About the project
Our Q&D team has started developing a model for predicting the parameters of a chemical compound based on its structural formulas. Medical scientists spend a lot of time and effort developing new drugs. This is due to the study of various compounds, the conduct of long-term biological experiments and risks such as toxic fumes and incorrectly calculated doses of chemicals. We offer an original solution that in the future can help doctors in creating medicines for diseases that are currently considered incurable (for example, cancer), as well as prevent pandemics like covid-19.
